## Implementation

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- [Dependency, library, or service needed]
- [Configuration that must exist]
- [Knowledge or skills required]

**Optional:**
- [Nice-to-have but not required]

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: [First Action - Be Specific]

[Detailed explanation of what to do and why]

**File:** `[path/to/file.ext]`

```[language]
// Complete, runnable code example
// Include all necessary imports
[code]
```

**Explanation:**
- [What this code does]
- [Why it's important]
- [Any gotchas to watch for]

#### Step 2: [Second Action]

[Detailed explanation]

**File:** `[path/to/file.ext]`

```[language]
// Another complete example
[code]
```

#### Step 3: [Third Action]

[Continue for all necessary steps]

### Complete Example

[Description of what this example demonstrates]

**File:** `[path/to/complete/example.ext]`

```[language]
// Full working example that ties everything together
// This should be copy-pasteable and run
// Include setup, main logic, and cleanup if needed

[complete code example]
```

**Output:**
```
[Expected output or result]
```

### Configuration

[If pattern requires configuration:]

**File:** `[config/file.ext]`

```[format]
# Configuration settings
[config example]
```

**Options:**
- `[setting_name]`: [What it does, default value]
- `[another_setting]`: [Description]
